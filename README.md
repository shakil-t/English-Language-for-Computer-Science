# English Language for Computer Science
This repository contains my project in the course English Language for Computer Science in 2019. I performed research on programming languages, in particular, non-English programming languages and Esoteric programming languages, and presented my own programming language [Lollipop Church](https://github.com/shakil-t/Lollipop-Church).
